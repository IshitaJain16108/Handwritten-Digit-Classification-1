# Handwritten-Digit-Classification
* The data files **train.csv** contain gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine.
* Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 783 pixels in total. 
* Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. 
* This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.
* The training data set, (train.csv), has 784 columns.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The first column, called "label", is the digit that was drawn by the user.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated image.
